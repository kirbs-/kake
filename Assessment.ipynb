    "## Task 1\n",
    "Your business partners are interested in:\n",
    "1. how many new products are in the market.\n",
    "2. Are there up and coming product categories we may need to train repair technicians on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a notebook, analyze the dataset and prepare 3-4 findings to present to your business partner. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2\n",
    "The business team wants to expand your analysis to products on Shopify. However, the Shopify dataset is missing a product category. Your task is to:\n",
    "1. using Python, create a classification model that predicts the column 'product_category' \n",
    "2. prepare a summary notebook with your analysis/findings\n",
    "3. create a list of questions we can ask the business in order to improve\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips:\n",
    "- Assume audience includes both technical people (who understand statistics and data science) as well as business members. \n",
    "- What questions can you ask your business partner to improve the analysis or model?\n",
    "- What are the strengths and weaknesses of your analysis.\n",
    "- Did you find any additional relationships in the data you can share?\n",
    "- Show your thought process and what analysis/model you wanted to peform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guidelines\n",
    "- You may modify this enviromnment as you want. \n",
    "- Core python 3.7 packages are installed; plus pandas.\n",
    "- You may use any package. To install use `%pip` cell magic. e.g. `%pip install pandas` will install pandas in this environment.\n",
    "- Please complete this asssessment within 24-48 hours. There's no deadline. \n",
    "- There are a lot of ways to analyze this dataset. Don't try to find everything. "
